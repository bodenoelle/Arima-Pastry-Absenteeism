# Arima-Pastry-Absenteeism

Project completed as part of the real life case studies under __10alytics__ Growth Internship Program (GIP).

In this project I used MS Excel to carefully study and analyze Arima Pastry employee data in order to establish if a relationship exists between employee's absenteeism and their common demographies like location, age group, department and length of service.

Conclusion from this analysis will help Arima Pastry identify the areas requiring support in order to reduce absenteeism and improve employee's work commitment and contribution.
